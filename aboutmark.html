   <p>Mark Zuckerberg, the architect of the social media revolution, is a tech titan who redefined how the world connects. Born in 1984 in White Plains, New York, Zuckerberg wasn’t just another kid who loved computers—he was a prodigy, coding his way to the top before most of us knew what coding even was.

    At Harvard, where most students were focused on grades and parties, Zuckerberg was busy creating a little project called Facebook. What started in a dorm room in 2004 as a way for students to connect quickly became a digital empire, changing the fabric of society. With a vision far beyond his years, he turned a social experiment into a platform that now boasts billions of users worldwide.
    
    But Zuckerberg didn’t stop at just connecting people; he saw the future and went after it. He led Facebook through acquisitions like Instagram and WhatsApp, expanding the empire and staying ahead of the curve. His rebranding of Facebook to Meta is a bold move, signaling his ambition to pioneer the next frontier—the metaverse.
    
    Mark Zuckerberg isn’t just a tech genius; he’s a visionary who took the digital world by storm, and he’s far from done. His legacy is one of innovation, relentless ambition, and a belief that the future is always just one breakthrough away.
